## Trainer Directives
THE UNILATERAL IMPERATIVE.

Since we are fixed at 34 lbs, we cannot stimulate the legs with standard squats. We must use 'The King of Pain' (Bulgarian Split Squats) to mechanically overload the quads.

Focus: Balance, depth, and maintaining a vertical spine. Do not rush.

## Trainer Closing Notes
1. On the Split Squats: Did grip fail before legs?
2. Knee Stability: Did the knee track over the toe, or collapse inward?
3. Protein: Did you hit the 150g target today?
