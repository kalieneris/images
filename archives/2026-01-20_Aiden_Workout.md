## Trainer Directives
The Saturnian Tax: 34 lbs fixed load. Focus: Clavicular Pec (shelf) and Lat density.

Note: If grip fails on rows, do not truncate the set. Use a 'hook' grip or brief pauses to ensure the back reaches failure, not just the fingers.

## Trainer Closing Notes
1. What was the RPE (1-10) for Block A? Did the 4-second negative force technical failure?
2. Protein Check: Did you clear 150g today?
3. Any unusual joint friction in the shoulders during the Incline Press?

## Athlete Feedback
Yes, definitely faced technical failure during block a. And the DR l tricep dips.
I'm currently at 83g protein. My post workout drink will add 26g and dinner will add more. Probably won't get all the way to 150 though. 
Didn't notice any joint friction. Did notice my upper back straining on one rep which clued me on to fix my form before I pulled something.
